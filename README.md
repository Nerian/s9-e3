# Academic Exercise: Digital Logic Simulator

_written by: Gregory Brown for Mendicant University core skills session #9_

I had a lot of fun coming up with the ["All Wired Up" PuzzleNode problem](http://puzzlenode.com/puzzles/18) 
that was part of this session's entrance 
exam. At the time I was writing it, I had thought about building a more 
generally useful tool for playing around with simulated digital circuits, 
but then I quickly got too busy to look into it further.

Then, I started playing Minecraft and my interest in circuitry simulations was
reignited! The game has a full system for doing all sorts of fun logical
processing based on the most primitive inputs. But Minecraft is much better
as a game than as a learning environment, and it can be a very frustrating
and tedious environment to try to study circuitry in. I want a tool that
doesn't make me afraid of being attacked by zombies while I build my logic
gates!

In this exercise, I would like you to build a tool that makes exploring
digital circuitry fun and interesting. The summary below provides some
suggestions on what things in particular I have in mind, but everyone
should be able to come up with their own unique take on the idea.

## Exercise Summary

- Design and model a game with the following features:
  - A map which can be represented as a graph structure
  - Rules that result in exponentially increasing danger as the game progresses
  - Resources which players must collect repeatedly in sets to win the game
  - Rules that create tension between slowing down immediate danger and
    collecting all the needed resources
- Create your own unique theme, don't copy the scenarios from the example games
- Implement at least a single player mode which demonstrates the game setup and the
  different actions that can take place on a turn.

## Submission Guidelines

If you plan to work on this exercise, you should fork this repository 
and push code early and often during the course. The course 
guidelines PDF explains the submission process in detail, but please 
contact an instructor if you have any questions.
